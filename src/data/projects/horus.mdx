## Overview

**HORUS** is a Flutter-based mobile application built for bird watchers and nature enthusiasts.  
It enables **offline bird species identification** using on-device AI models, without requiring an internet connection.

## AI Pipeline

HORUS integrates pretrained models from **OSEA Mobile**:

- **Detection**: SSD MobileNet
- **Classification**: ResNet34 trained using MetaFGNet
- **Dataset**: DongNiao DIB-10K

All inference is performed **locally on the device**.

## Key Features

- Camera-based bird recognition
- Image import and carousel browsing
- Curated bird information for Bengaluru
- Fully offline operation for field environments

## Why Offline Matters

Birding often happens in remote or low-connectivity areas.  
Offline inference ensures **privacy, reliability, and consistent usability**.

## Conclusion

HORUS demonstrates how modern mobile devices can run **production-grade AI pipelines locally**, enabling practical real-world ML applications.
