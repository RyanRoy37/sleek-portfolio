## Overview

This project explores **rate limiting as a core API security mechanism** for protecting backend services from abuse, enumeration, and DoS-style traffic.

The system demonstrates and compares four widely used rate limiting algorithms implemented in **FastAPI** and tested under realistic load conditions.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **Fixed Window**
- **Sliding Window Counter**
- **Token Bucket**
- **Leaky Bucket**

Each limiter is applied **per client**, identified using the `X-Client-ID` header or request IP.

## How It Works

- Extract client identifier
- Select limiter using query parameter
- Apply `allow_request(key)`
- Return response with standard rate-limit headers

## Benchmarking & Results

Load testing was performed using **Apache JMeter**:
- 50 concurrent threads
- 10-second ramp-up
- 100 iterations
- 111 seconds total duration

### Key Observations

- **Token Bucket** delivered consistent throughput (15–20 TPS)
- **Sliding Window** showed strict enforcement with higher rejection rates
- **Fixed Window** degraded over time due to boundary effects
- **Leaky Bucket** exhibited moderate but unpredictable spike behavior

## Conclusion

This project enables **data-driven selection of rate limiting strategies** for production APIs, API gateways, and microservices architectures.
